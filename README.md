## Credits

I, Elias Feij√≥, had to create an API for a personal project from scratch, and decided to make it reusable.

I was inspired by some of the code in [bancodobrasil](https://github.com/bancodobrasil) repositories, such as [featws-api](https://github.com/bancodobrasil/featws-api) and [goauth](https://github.com/bancodobrasil/goauth), some of those I've contributed and even was the solo maintainer. Changed a lot of things, but I'm still grateful for the inspiration.

Hope you enjoy it!
